# Design notes: lobbies, matchmaking, watching

Status: **ideas written down, not built yet.** "Decided" is what Cody asked for. "Open questions" are gaps
Claude filled in as proposals; nothing there is final until Cody picks.

## Decided

### Ranked: Play now opens the "FFA RANKED" lobby
- Title: **FFA RANKED**.
- **Auto match** is the main button.
- **Tournament** sits under Auto match, **greyed out, "Coming soon"**.
- Below that, a **list of games being played right now**, each with a **Watch now** button.

### Auto match (ranked)
Search in this order:
1. Players with **similar rank points**.
2. If that doesn't fill it, **any other real players**.
3. Then **bots** fill the rest.

The rules already agreed still apply: 3–8 players, at least 2 real, 1–3 bots, 1 ticket to enter, 10 points
per player in the pot (bots included), bots can win, and bots play under player-style names.

### Unranked: Play now opens a lobby
- First pick the game type: **FFA** or **TEAM**.
- Then the same lobby layout as ranked (Auto match plus the live games list with Watch now), with **no Tournament**.

### Wager
- Later.

## Open questions (proposals to confirm)

1. **How wide the rank search goes, and how fast.** Proposal: look for players within ±50 rank points
   for 10 seconds, then ±150 for 10 seconds, then any real players. At 30 seconds, start with bots
   if at least 2 real players are ready.
2. **One real player searching alone.** Ranked needs 2 real players. Proposal: keep waiting and show
   "Looking for another player…", with a one-tap switch to unranked while you wait.
3. **When the ticket is spent.** Proposal: when the match starts. Leaving before then costs nothing
   (matches the "refund if you leave before start" rule).
4. **Watching costs messages.** Every viewer receives the live game updates, and Supabase's free plan
   counts each one. Proposal: cap viewers per game (e.g. 4) on the free plan. Raise the cap on our own
   game server later.
5. **What watchers see.** Proposal: the match from above with name tags and the scoreboard, no emotes,
   and a "Watching" badge. Ranked matches show the pot size.
6. **Live games list details.** Proposal: each row shows mode, players (e.g. 6/8), round (2/3), time
   left, and the leader's name and score. Most-watched first.
7. **Where private rooms and practice go in the unranked lobby.** Proposal: Auto match replaces
   today's Quick play. "Private room (code)" and "Practice vs bots" become smaller buttons under it.
8. **Ranked teams.** The lobby title says FFA only. Confirm there's no ranked TEAM mode for now.
9. **Tournament details** (brackets, entry, prizes): later, when it comes off "Coming soon".

## Economy (decided)

- **All prices are set in US dollars and paid in SANTA** at the current SANTA price.
- **Ranked tickets:** 50% burned, 50% to the treasury.
- **Avatar items:** 50% burned, 50% to the treasury.
- **Lottery:** 90% to winners, 10% burned.

### How to make it work (proposals)
- **One transaction does the whole split.** When a player buys, their wallet signs a single transaction
  that burns their half directly from their own SANTA (a real burn that lowers total supply, not a send
  to a dead address) and sends the other half to the treasury. Nothing sits with us in between, and
  anyone can check it on a Solana explorer.
- **Price quote.** Look up the SANTA price when the player taps Buy (for example from DexScreener or
  Jupiter), lock it for about 60 seconds, and show "$0.50 ≈ 642 SANTA" before they sign.
- **Server confirms before granting.** The server checks the transaction on-chain (Cody already has
  Helius), then adds the item or tickets. A payment that doesn't confirm grants nothing.
- **Lottery.** Entries go into a lottery wallet; the draw uses verifiable on-chain randomness (the site's
  Advent draws already work this way); 90% is paid to winners and 10% burned in the same payout.
- **Burn tracker.** A small public counter of total SANTA burned by the game, a nice trust signal.

### More ways to spend or burn SANTA (ideas, answering "any other ideas?")
- Name changes after the first free one.
- Emote packs (new speech bubbles).
- Snowball trails and hat-catch effects.
- Clan banners or colors shown in matches.
- A seasonal pass with a cosmetic reward track.
- Extra daily-challenge rerolls.

## Technical notes for when this gets built

- The live games list needs a server-side list of running rooms (a lobby channel or a database table
  the referee updates). A browser can't see other rooms without it.
- Matchmaking by rank points should run on the server (with the cheat-proof referee), so players
  can't pick their own opponents or fake their points.
- Spectators join a room as watchers: they receive snapshots but send nothing, and never count as players.
